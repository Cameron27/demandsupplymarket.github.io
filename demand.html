                <h3>Needs and Wants</h3>
                <p>When looking at anything we buy they can be broken down into two categories, needs and wants. Needs are the things we have to have to survive, these generally come under the categories of food, shelter and clothing. A want is anything else that we don’t need to survive but want to have due to the satisfaction we get from it. We have an unlimited number of wants, there is always something else we would like to have, whether or not it can be bought with money.</p>

                <h3>Resources</h3>
                <p>Resources are things that are used in the production of goods and services to for fill our needs and wants, they are the input into the production process. There are three kinds of resources:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Natural resources – these are “Gifts of nature” and can be generally thought of as things that would be here even if humans weren’t, these can be either <a href="#" title="Definition: a natural resource that will never be used up as long as we manage them properly" class="tooltip">renewable</a> or <a href="#" title="Definition: a natural resource that there is only a limited amount of available and once it is all used up there is no more" class="tooltip">non-renewable</a> i.e. trees or oil respectively</li>
                    <li>Capital goods – these are man-made things that are used in the production of other goods and services i.e. a hammer or a plank of wood</li>
                    <li>Human resources – these are humans which exert either a physical or mental effort in the production of a good or service i.e. a carpenter or a teacher</li>
                </ul>
                <p>There are only a limited number of resources available for us to use!!!</p>

                <h3>Scarcity and Opportunity Cost</h3>
                <p>Scarcity (or the basic economic problem) is the central idea behind economics, it is the idea that we have an unlimited amount of wants but only a limited amount of resources to fulfil them with. This means that we are forced to make decisions about what we want to do with our limited resources of time, money and knowledge. An opportunity cost is the next best alternative forgone when a decision is made. For example if you want to go to the movies, top up your phone and eat out but can only afford one, you have to make a choice, if you chose to go to the movies the opportunity cost could be eating out because that is the next thing you would have wanted to do. Topping up your phone is not an opportunity cost as in isn’t the NEXT best alternative.</p>

                <h3>Values and Compromises</h3>
                <p>A value is something that you believe in that can affect how/what decisions you make, some examples of different values are education, family, helping others out, maximising your time alive etc. A compromise is something you have to make when two or more values (whether they be all yours or a combination of yours and someone else’s) in order to uphold both of those values. An example of this is that you believe that you should give money to charity but at the same time you need to save money to go to university. Here we have two conflicting values of education and helping others out, in this situation a compromise would be to donate less to charity while you are saving for university but once you have graduated you will donate more, as you will have a higher paying job, to make up for it.</p>

                <h3>Law of Demand</h3>
                <p>Demand is the willingness and ability for a <a href="#" title="Definition: a person who buys a good or service for personal use" class="tooltip">consumer</a> to buy a good or service at different price levels, this means that the consumer has to want the product and they also have to be able to pay for the product before there is any demand for it. This idea leads to the Law of Demand which states: As price increases <a href="#" title="Note: this is the term we use when talking about a shift along the demand curve" class="tooltip">quantity demanded</a> decreases, ceteris paribus. (Definition: assuming all other factors stay the same) These factors will be covered later. From this we can construct an example table of what someone’s demand for a product may look like:</p>
                <table>
                    <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th colspan="2">Jacob’s Demand for Guitar Lessons per Month</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Price ($ per class)</th>
                        <th>Number of lessons</th>
                    </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>5</td>
                        <td>8</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>10</td>
                        <td>7</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>15</td>
                        <td>6</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>25</td>
                        <td>3</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>30</td>
                        <td>1</td>
                    </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
                <p>As we can see from this as the price of the guitar lessons go up, the quantity demanded goes down as we would expect.</p>

                <h3>Demand Curve</h3>
                <p>A demand curve is a simple way of displaying the demand for a good or service, if we continue with the example above it would look like this:</p>
                <a href="images/demand1.png"><img src="images/demand1.png" class="normalsize" alt="Jacobs Demand Curve for Guitar Lessons per Month"></a>
                <p>As we can see from above, if the price was at $25 then the quantity demanded would be 3 classes per month. The downwards direction of the curve reflects the Law of Demand. We can also use a demand curve to demonstrate the effect of a change in price on the quantity demanded.</p>
                <a href="images/demand2.png"><img src="images/demand2.png" class="normalsize" alt="Jacobs Demand Curve for Guitar Lessons per Month (Change in Price)"></a>
                <p>As we can see here, when the price of the guitar lessons drop from $25 to $10 the quantitly demanded rises from 3 lessons to 7 lessons per month. This is because, as the The Law of Demand states, when price decreases quantity demanded increases, ceteris paribus. This is reflected in the graph as when the price drops from $25 to $10 the quantity demanded by Jacob increased from 3 to 7 lessons per month. This is because they are now more affondable so Jacob is now both willing and able to pay for more lessons.</p>

                <h3>Shifting Demand Curve</h3>
                <p>At the end of the Law of Demand we say ceteris paribus, this means assuming all other factors remain the same. However, if another factor is affected, this will have an effect on our demand curve, namely, it will shift the demand curve to the right or the left. There are 4 main factors that will shift the demand curve:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Change in income – if a house hold has a change in income this means they will be able to afford more or less of a product, if income increases this will increase <a href="#" title="Note: this is the term we use when we talk about a shift in the demand curve (we don’t say quantity demanded)" class="tooltip">demand</a> as the product is now more affordable and if income decreases this will decrease demand as the product is now less affordable</li>
                    <li>Change in price for complementary goods – a complementary good is a good that is normally consumed alongside another good i.e. popcorn is a complementary good for cinema tickets, if the price of a complementary good decreases this will increase demand and if the price of a complementary good increases this will decrease demand</li>
                    <li>Change in price of substitute good – a substitute good is a good that is consumed instead of another good i.e. bus tickets are a substitute good for train tickets, if the price of a substitute good increases this will increase demand as the product is relatively more affordable and if the price of a substitute good decreases it will decrease demand as the product is relatively less affordable</li>
                    <li>Change in tastes and fashion – this more or less covers any other influence of demand and can be affected by things like advertising, the latest trend and world events, if tastes increases this will increase demand as the product is relatively more desirably and if tastes decreases this will decrease demand as the product is relatively less desirably</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If we go back to Jacob and his guitar lessons we can get an example of this. Let’s say that Jacob is also learning the drums and the drum instructor lowers his lesson costs by $1, this will decrease Jacobs demand for his guitar lessons as the drum lessons are a substitute good.</p>

                        <th>Number of Lessons after drum lesson price drops</th>

                        <td>3</td>
                        <td>2</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>30</td>
                        <td>1</td>
                        <td>0</td>
                    </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
                <p>From this we can create a graph that shows this decrease in demand and it would look like this:</p>
                    <a href="images/demand3.png"><img src="images/demand3.png" class="normalsize" alt="Jacobs Demand Curve for Guitar Lessons per Month (Change in Demand)"></a>
                <p>As we can see, due to the decrease in the cost of drum lessons, a substitute good for guitar lessons, this causes a decrease in demand at each and every price point because guitar lessons are now relatively more expensive and therefore less of them are demanded. As a result, at the price point of $15 Jacob’s demand will fall from 6 guitar lessons per month to 5 lessons per month.</p>

                <h3>Luxury Goods, Inferior Goods and Necessities</h3>
                <p>When looking at kinds of goods there are three groups we can put them into:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Luxury goods – these are what we would classify most goods under and are goods that we want and therefore as our income rises we demand more of them because they are now more affordable i.e. prime steaks</li>
                    <li>Inferior goods – these are low quality goods that we generally buy because we can’t afford anything better and therefore as out income rises we demand less of them because we start to buy luxury goods instead i.e. sausage meat</li>
                    <li>Necessities – these are goods that we only need a certain amount of because they are essential to our everyday lives but beyond that we don’t need any more and therefore as our income rises to a certain point our demand for them increases but pass that point as income rises our demand stays the same</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These distinctions are important as they have an effect on how much we spend on these goods as there is a change in our personal income levels.</p>

                <h3>Proportions of Income</h3>
                <p>As our income increases the proportion of our income that we spend on the above different kinds of goods changes. As income rises the proportion we spend on luxury goods increases as most of any new income earned will go towards more luxury goods. The proportion of our income we spend on inferior goods will rapidly decrease however because we will not buy more of them and over time actually start spending less on them until a point where we might stop buying them completely. Finally, the proportion of our income we spend on necessities will decrease because although we will still spend around the same amount of money on them, our total income is higher so that same amount of money is now a lower proportion of your total income.</p>

                    <li>Capital goods – a man-made good used in the production of other goods or services</li>
                    <li>Human resource – a person who exerts either a physical or mental effort in the production process</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Scarcity and Opportunity Cost Key Points</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scarcity – the idea of having an unlimited number of wants but only a limited number of resources to fulfil them with</li>
                    <li>Opportunity cost – the next best alternative forgone when a decision is made</li>
                </ul>

                </ul>

                <h3>Demand Curve Key Points</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Change in price – this will cause a movement along the demand curve resulting in a change in the quantity demanded following the Law of Demand</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Shifting Demand Curve Key Points</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Change in other factors – this is when anything, other than the price, changes that could have an effect on demand, namely change in income, change in price of complementary good, change in price of substitute good and change in tastes and fashion</li>
                    <li>Complementary good – a good that is normally consumed alongside another good</li>
                    <li>Substitute good – a good that is normally consumed instead of another good</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Luxury good – a high quality good we demand more of as income increases, the proportion of income spent on it increases with income</li>
                    <li>Inferior good – a low quality good we demand less of as income increases, the proportion of income spent on it decreases with income</li>
                    <li>Necessity – a good that we need a certain amount of to survive but not anymore beyond that, the proportion of income spent on it decreases with income</li>
