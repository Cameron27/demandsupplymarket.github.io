                <h3>Needs and Wants</h3>
                <p>When looking at anything we buy they can be broken down into two categories, needs and wants. Needs are the things we need to survive, these generally come under the categories of food, shelter and clothing. A want (or a luxury good) is anything else that we don’t need to survive but want to buy due to the satisfaction we get from it. We have an unlimited number of wants, we always want something more.</p>

                <h3>Resources</h3>
                <p>Resources are things that use in the production of other goods and services, they are the input into the production process. There are three kinds of resources:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Natural resources – these are “Gifts of nature” and can be generally thought of as things that would be here even if humans weren’t, these can be either renewable (they will never be used up as long as we manage them properly) or non-renewable (there is only a limited amount of it available and once it is all used it is all gone) i.e. trees or oil respectively</li>
                    <li>Capital goods – these are man-made things that are used in the production of other goods and services i.e. a hammer or a plank of wood</li>
                    <li>Human resources – these are humans which exert either a physical or mental effort in the production of a good or service</li>
                </ul>
                <p>There are only a limited number of resources available for us to use.</p>

                <h3>Scarcity and Opportunity Cost</h3>
                <p>Scarcity (or the basic economic problem) is the central idea behind economics, it is the idea that we have an unlimited amount of wants but only a limited amount of resources to fulfil them with. This means that we are forces to make decisions about what we want to do with our limited resources of time, money and knowledge. An opportunity cost is the next be alternative forgone when a decision is made. For example if you want to go to the movies, top up your phone and eat out but can only afford one, you have to make a choice, if you chose to go to the movies the opportunity cost could be eating out because that is the next thing you would have wanted to do. NOTE: Topping up your phone is not an opportunity cost as in isn’t the NEXT best alternative.</p>

                <h3>Values and Compromises</h3>
                <p>A value is something that you believe in that can affect how/what decisions you make, some examples of different values are education, family, giving, enjoying life etc. A compromise is something that you have to make when two or more values (whether they be two of yours or one of yours and one of someone else’s) in order to uphold both of those values. An example of this is that you believe that you should give money to charity but at the same time you need to save money to go to university. Here we have to conflicting values of education and giving, in this situation a compromise would be to donate less to charity while you are saving for university but once you have graduated you will donate more as you will have a higher paying job to make up for it.</p>

                <h3>Law of Demand</h3>
                <p>Demand is the willingness and ability for a consumer to buy a good or service at different price levels, this mean that the consumer have to want the product and they also have to be able to pay for the product before there is any demand for it. This idea leads to the Law of Demand which states: As price increased quantity demanded decreases, ceteris paribus. NOTE: Ceteris paribus means “assuming all other factors stay the same”, these factories will be covered later. From this we can construct an example table of what someone’s demand for a product may look like:</p>
                <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th colspan="2">Jacob’s Demand for Guitar Lessons per Month</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Price ($ per class)</th>
                        <th>Number of lessons</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>5</td>
                        <td>8</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>10</td>
                        <td>7</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>15</td>
                        <td>6</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>25</td>
                        <td>3</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>30</td>
                        <td>1</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
                </table>
                <p>As we can see from this as the price of the guitar lessons go up, the quantity demanded goes down as we would expect.</p>

                <h3>Demand Curve</h3>
                <p>A demand curve is the simplest way of displaying the demand for a good or service, if we continue with the example above it would look like this:</p>
                <img src="images/demand1.jpg" alt="Jacob's Demand Curve for Guitar Lessons per Month" class="normalsize">
                <p>As we can see from above, if the price was at $25 then the quantity demanded would be 3 classes per month. The downwards direction of the curve reflects the Law of Demand. We can also use a demand curve to demonstrate the effect of a change in price on the quantity demanded.</p>
                <img src="images/demand3.jpg" alt="Jacob's Demand Curve for Guitar Lessons per Month (Change in Price on Demand Curve)" class="normalsize">
                <p>As we can see here, when the price of the guitar lessons drop from $25 to $10 the quantitly demanded rises from 3 lessons to 7 lessons per month. To discribe this we would say: The Law of Demand states that as price decreased quantity demanded increases, ceteris paribus. This is reflected in the graph as when the price drops from $25 to $10 the quantity demanded be Jacob increased from 3 to 7 lessons per month. This is because they are now more affondable so jacob is now both willing and able to pay for more lessons.</p>

                <h3>Shifting Demand Curve</h3>
                <p>At the end of the Law of Demand we say ceteris paribus, this means assuming all other factors remain the same. However, if another factor is affected, this will have an effect on our demand curve, namely, it will shift the demand curve to the right or the left. There are 4 main factors that will shit the demand curve:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Change in income – if a house hold has a change in income this means they will be able to afford more or less of a product, if income increases this will increase demand and if income decreases this will decrease demand</li>
                    <li>Change is price for complementary goods – a complementary good is a good that is normally consumed alongside another good i.e. popcorn is a complementary good of cinema tickets, if the price of a complementary good goes down this will increase demand and if the price of a complementary good goes up it will decrease demand</li>
                    <li>Change in price of substitute good – a substitute good id a good that is consumed instead of another good i.e. bus tickets are a substitute good of train tickets, if the price of a substitute good goes up this will increase demand and if the price of a substitute good goes down it will decrease demand</li>
                    <li>Change in tastes and fashion – this more or less covers any other influence of demand and can be affected by things like advertising, what is the latest trend and political views, if tastes increases this will increase demand and if tastes decreases this will decrease demand</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If we go back to Jacob and his guitar lessons we can get an example of this. Let’s say that Jacob is also learning the drums and the drum instructor lowers his lesson costs by $1, this will decrease Jacobs demand for his guitar lessons as the drum lessons are a substitute good.</p>

                    </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
                <p>From this we can create a graph that shows this decrease in demand</p>
                <img src="images/demand3.jpg" alt="Jacob's Demand Curve for Guitar Lessons per Month (Shifting the Demand Curve)" class="normalsize">
                <p>As we can see, due to the decrease in the cost of drum lessons, a substitute good for guitar lessons, this causes a decrease in demand at each and every price point because guitar lessons are now relatively more expensive and there for less of it is demanded. As a result, at the price point of $15 Jacob’s demand will fall from 6 guitar lessons per month to 5 lessons per month.</p>

                <h3>Luxury Goods, Inferior Goods and Necessities</h3>
                <p>When looking at kinds of goods there are three groups we can put them into:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Luxury goods – there are what we would classify most goods under and are goods that we want and therefore as our income rises we demand more of them because they are now more affordable i.e. prime steaks</li>
                    <li>Inferior goods – these are low quality goods that we generally buy because we can’t afford anything better and therefore as out income rises we demand less of them because we start to buy luxury goods instead i.e. sausage meat</li>
                    <li>Necessities – these are goods that we only need a certain amount of because that are essential to our everyday lives but beyond that we don’t need any more and therefore as our income rises to a certain point our demand for them increases but pas that point as income rises our demand stays the same</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These distinctions are important as they have an effect on how much we spend on these goods as there is a change in our personal income levels.</p>

                <h3>Proportions of Income</h3>
                <p>As our income increases the proportion of our income that we spend of the above different kinds of goods changes. As income rises the proportion we spend of luxury goods increases as most of any new income earned will go towards more luxury goods. The proportion of our income we spend on inferior goods will rapidly decrease however because we will not buy more of them and over time actually start spending less on them until a point where we might stop buying them completely. Finally, the proportion of our income we spend on necessities will decrease because although we will still spend the same amount of money on them, our total income is higher so that same amount of money is now a lower proportion of your total income. </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Change in other factors – this is when anything else, other than the price, changes that could have an effect on demand, namely change in income, change in price of complementary good, change in price of substitute good and change in tastes and fashion</li>
                    <li>Complementary good – a good that is normally consumed alongside another good</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Luxury good – a good that we demand more of as income increases, the proportion of income spent on it increases with income</li>
                    <li>Inferior good – a good we demand less of as income increases, the proportion of income spent on it decreases with income</li>
                    <li>Necessity – a good that we need a certain amount of to survive but not anymore beyond that, the proportion of income spent on it decreases with income</li>
