                <h3>Law of Supply</h3>
                <p><a href="#" title="That&apos;s what this widget is and here is a lot more text" class="tooltip">Supply</a> is the willingness and ability for a producers to sell a good or service at different price levels, this means that the price of the product has to be high enough to cover the costs of production to the produces and provide him with a profit they is happy with. This idea leads to the Law of Supply which states: As price increased quantity supplied increases, ceteris paribus. From this we can construct an example table of what someone’s supply for a product may look like:</p>
                <table>
                    <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th colspan="2">Jacob’s Supply for Running Shoes per Month</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Price ($ per pair of shoes)</th>
                        <th>Number of pairs of shoes</th>
                    </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>80</td>
                        <td>1000</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>100</td>
                        <td>1500</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>130</td>
                        <td>2000</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>180</td>
                        <td>2000</td>
                    </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
                <p>As we can see from this as the price of the shoes go up, the quantity supplied goes up as we would expect.</p>

                <h3>Supply Curve</h3>
                <p>A supply curve is the simplest way of displaying the supply for a good or service, if we continue with the example above it would look like this:</p>
                <a href="images/supply1.png"><img src="images/supply1.png" alt="Jacob's Supply Curve for Pairs of Shoes per Month" class="normalsize"></a>
                <p>As we can see from above, if the price was at $100 then the quantity supplied would be 1500 shoes per month. The upwards direction of the curve reflects the Law of Supply. We can also use a supply curve to demonstrate the effect of a change in price on the quantity supply.</p>
                <a href="images/supply2.png"><img src="images/supply2.png" alt="Jacob's Supply Curve for Pairs of Shoes per Month (Change in Price on Supply Curve)" class="normalsize"></a>
                <p>As we can see here, when the price of the shoes increase from $100 to $130 the quantitly supplied rises from 1500 pairs of shoes to 2000 pairs of shoes. To discribe this we would say: The Law of Supply states that as price increases quantity supplied increases, ceteris paribus. This is reflected in the graph as when the price riese from $100 to 130 the quantity supplied by Jacob increased from 1500 to 2000 pairs of shoes per month. This is because they are now more profitable so Jacob is now both willing and able to produce for shoes.</p>

                <h3>Shifting Supply Curve</h3>
                <p>At the end of the Law of Supply we say ceteris paribus, this means assuming all other factors remain the same. However, if another factor is affected, this will have an effect on our supply curve, namely, it will shift the supply curve to the right or the left. There are 4 main factors that will shit the supply curve:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Change in income – if a house hold has a change in income this means they will be able to afford more or less of a product, if income increases this will increase demand and if income decreases this will decrease demand</li>
                    <li>Change is price for complementary goods – a complementary good is a good that is normally consumed alongside another good i.e. popcorn is a complementary good of cinema tickets, if the price of a complementary good goes down this will increase demand and if the price of a complementary good goes up it will decrease demand</li>
                    <li>Change in price of substitute good – a substitute good id a good that is consumed instead of another good i.e. bus tickets are a substitute good of train tickets, if the price of a substitute good goes up this will increase demand and if the price of a substitute good goes down it will decrease demand</li>
                    <li>Change in tastes and fashion – this more or less covers any other influence of demand and can be affected by things like advertising, what is the latest trend and political views, if tastes increases this will increase demand and if tastes decreases this will decrease demand</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If we go back to Jacob and his shoe shop we can get an example of this. Let’s say that Jacob introduces new technology into his workshop that can replace the human resources and work at a faster rate than them, this will increase Jacobs supply for his shoes as he can now produce them at a faster rate and there will be a reduced the cost of production as he no longer has to pay workers.</p>

                        <td>2000</td>
                        <td>2400</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>180</td>
                        <td>3000</td>
                        <td>3500</td>
                    </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
                <p>From this we can create a graph that shows this decrease in supply</p>
                <a href="images/supply3.png"><img src="images/supply3.png" alt="Jacob's Supply Curve for Pairs of Shoes per Month (Shifting the Supply Curve)" class="normalsize"></a>
                <p>As we can see, due to the new technology being introduced this causes an increase in supply at each and every price point because running shoes are now relatively more profitable and there for Jacob is more willing to supply them. As a result, at the price point of $130 Jacob’s supply will fall from 2000 pairs of shoes per month to 2400 pairs of shoes per month.</p>

                <ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Change in price – this will cause a movement along the supply curve resulting in a change in the quantity supply following the Law of Supply</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Shifting Supply Curve Key Points</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Change in other factors – this is when anything else, other than the price, changes that could have an effect on supply, namely change in costs of production, change in price of alternative good, change in productivity and technology</li>
                    <li>Alternative good – a good that can be produced instead of another good using similar resources</li>
                    <li>Productivity – the efficiency at which resources are being used in the production process</li>
                </ul>
