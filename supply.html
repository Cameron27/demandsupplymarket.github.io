                <h3>Law of Supply</h3>
                <p>Supply is the willingness and ability for a <span title="Definition: a person or company who sells a good or service" class="tooltip">producer</span> to sell a good or service at different price levels, this means that the producer has to want to sell the product and they also have to be able to pay for the production before there is any supply for it. This idea leads to the Law of Supply which states: As price increases, <span title="Note: this is the term we use when talking about a shift along the supply curve" class="tooltip">quantity supplied</span> increases, ceteris paribus. These factors will be covered later. From this we can construct an example table of what someone’s supply for a product may look like:</p>
                <table>
                    <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th colspan="2">Jacob’s Supply for Running Shoes per Month</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Price ($ per pair of shoes)</th>
                        <th>Number of pairs of shoes</th>
                    </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>80</td>
                        <td>1000</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>100</td>
                        <td>1500</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>130</td>
                        <td>2000</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>180</td>
                        <td>3000</td>
                    </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
                <p>As we can see from this, as the price of the shoes go up, the quantity supplied goes up as we would expect.</p>

                <h3>Supply Curve</h3>
                <p>A supply curve is a simple way of displaying the supply for a good or service, if we continue with the example above it would look like this:</p>
                <a href="images/supply1.png"><img src="images/supply1.png" class="normalsize" alt="Jacob's Supply Curve for Running Shoes per Month"></a>
                <p>As we can see from above, if the price was at $100 then the quantity supplied would be 1500 pairs of shoes per month. The upwards direction of the curve reflects the Law of Supply. We can also use a supply curve to demonstrate the affect of a change in price on the quantity supplied.</p>
                <a href="images/supply2.png"><img src="images/supply2.png" class="normalsize" alt="Jacob's Supply Curve for Running Shoes per Month (Change in Price)"></a>
                <p>As we can see here, when the price of pairs of shoes increases from $100 to $120, the quantitly supplied rises from 1500 pairs of shoes to 2000 pairs of shoes per month. This is because, as the The Law of Supply states, when price, increases quantity supplied increases, ceteris paribus. This is reflected in the graph as when the price increases from $100 to $120 the quantity supplied by Jacob increased from 1500 to 2000 pairs of shoes per month. This is because they are now more profitable so Jacob is now both willing and able to sell more pairs of shoes.</p>

                <h3>Shifting Supply Curve</h3>
                <p>At the end of the Law of Supply we say ceteris paribus, this means assuming all other factors remain the same. However, if another factor is affected, this will have an effect on our supply curve, namely, it will shift the supply curve to the right or the left. There are 4 main factors that will shift the supply curve:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Change in cost of production – changes in cost of production affect the profit that a producer gets from their products. If costs of production increase this will decrease supply as the product is now less profitable. As costs of production decrease this will increase supply as the product is now more profitable</li>
                    <li>Change in price of a related goods – a related good is a good that can be produced using the same or similar resources as another good e.g. potato production is a related good to carrot production. If the price of a related good decreases this will increase supply as the product is now relatively more profitable. If the price of a related good increases this will decrease supply as the product is now relatively less profitable</li>
                    <li>Change in productivity – productivity is the efficiency at which resources are being used in the production process. If productivity increases this will increase supply as the product is now more profitable. If productivity decreases this will decrease supply as the product is now less profitable. Productivity is calculated with output/input</li>
                    <li>Technology – this one comes under the productivity section for the most part and is really anything to do with technology that can affect production. If new technology is introduced this will increase supply as the product is now more profitable. If technology breaks this will decrease supply as the product is now less profitable</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If we go back to Jacob and his pairs of shoes we can get an example of this. Let’s say that Jacob introduces new technology into his work shop, this will increase Jacob's supply of pairs of shoes as there is a productivity increase.</p>

                    </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
                <p>From this we can create a graph that shows this decrease in supply and it would look like this:</p>
                <a href="images/supply3.png"><img src="images/supply3.png" class="normalsize" alt="Jacob's Supply Curve for Running Shoes per Month (Cahnge in Supply)"></a>
                <p>As we can see, due to the increase in productivity there is an increase in <span title="Note: this is the term we use when we talk about a shift in the supply curve (we don’t say quantity supply)" class="tooltip">supply</span> at each and every price point because shoes are now more profitable to produce. As a result, at the price point of $130 Jacob’s supply will rise from 2000 pairs of shoes per month to 2400 pairs of shoes per month.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Change in price – this will cause a movement along the supply curve resulting in a change in the quantity supply following the Law of Supply</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Change in other factors – this is when anything else, other than the price, changes that could have an effect on supply, namely change in costs of production, change in price of a related good, change in productivity and technology</li>
                    <li>Related good – a good that can be produced instead of another good using similar resources</li>
                    <li>Productivity – the efficiency at which resources are being used in the production process, calculated with output/input</li>
