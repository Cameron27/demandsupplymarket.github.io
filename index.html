                <p>Welcome to DemandSupplyMarket, this website is about the basic economic theory behind demand, supply and the market. This website has been designed as a revision tool to be used for the NCEA level 1 externals for Economics.</p><br>
                <p>The website is split into the 3 different standards, Demand (1.1), Supply (1.3) and The Market (1.4). Each of these sections is then further split up into the different sections of the topic and these are generally the different questions you will get in the test. This site uses examples for all the theory and also has graphs where needed that are the same or similar to the kind you have to be able to draw. All the examples are then carefully explained with correct economic terms.</p>
