                <p>Welcome to DemandSupplyMarket. This website is about the basic economic theory behind demand, supply and the market. This website has been designed as a revision tool to be used for the NCEA level 1 externals for Economics.</p><br>
                <p>The website is split into the 3 different standards, Demand (1.1), Supply (1.3) and The Market (1.4). Under each section there are different subtitle that are split based on how the end of year test questions are asked. This site uses examples for all the theory and also has graphs when needed that are the same or similar to the kind you will be required to draw. All the examples are then carefully explained with the correct economic terms.</p>
