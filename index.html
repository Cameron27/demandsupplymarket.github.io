                <p>Welcome to DemandSupplyMarket, this website is about the basic economic theory to do with demand, supply and the market. This website is based around the NCEA Level 1 syllabus but the general ideas can be applied any study of economic theory.</p>
                <p>Within the website we will cover the basic economic problem, some areas of consumer chose and spending patterns, what demand is, what supply is, what the market is and how there are shifts within the market and what causes them. At the end there is also a quiz you can take to test your knowledge of basic economic theory.</p>
